![grav](https://getgrav.org/user/pages/media/grav-logo.svg)

Grav is a Fast, Simple, and Flexible file-based Web-platform. There is Zero installation required. Although Grav follows principles similar to other flat-file CMS platforms, it has a different design philosophy than most.

The underlying architecture of Grav is built using well established and best-in-class technologies. This is to ensure that Grav is simple to use and easy to extend. Some of these key technologies include:

* Twig Templating: for powerful control of the user interface
* Markdown: for easy content creation
* YAML: for simple configuration
* Parsedown: for fast Markdown and Markdown Extra support
* Doctrine Cache: for performance
* Pimple Dependency Injection Container: for extensibility and maintainability
* Symfony Event Dispatcher: for plugin event handling
* Symfony Console: for CLI interface
* Gregwar Image Library: for dynamic image manipulation

#### Tag information

+ **admin:** GRAV Core + [Grav-Admin-Plugin](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-admin)

## Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-p 80` | http |
| `-e DUID=1000` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `-e DGID=1000` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `-e GRAV_MULTISITE=subdirectory` | Deploy a Grav multisite (subdirectory) installation |
| `-v /var/www/backup` | Contains your location for Grav backups |
| `-v /var/www/logs` | Contains your location for your Grav log files |
| `-v /var/www/user` | Contains your Grav content |

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `DUID` and group `DGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `DUID=1000` and `DGID=1000`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id username
    uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup)
```

## Accessing the application
Access the webui at `http://<your-ip>`, for more information check out [GRAV](https://getgrav.org/)

## Using the container

+ Shell Access to container when it is running: `docker exec -it grav /bin/bash`
+ To monitor the logs of the container in realtime: `docker logs -f grav`
